    "note": "I have used django for few projects and used heroku to deploy. I have been looking into front-end frameworks such as Ember, Angular and was confused as to how it will integrate with a django project. Reading some Docs, it appears i need to have developed a REST api for my app using the backend framework in order for Javascript framework to communicate with the database. In this case the backend mostly works as a thin layer that provides access to the database. But what if I use something like parse and their Javascript API, would I even need a Backend Framework like Django?"

    "author": "Jack",
    "note": " have pulled ember with bower and I see various files. I do understand that I will have to add ember.min.js and ember-template-compiler.js to start working with ember. But I see other files that I am curious of: ember.debug.js, ember.prod.js, ember.testing.js. Can anyone describe purpose of these files?"
